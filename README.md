# Codebattles October Hackathon

An API that outputs a list of developer advocates with their details such as where they work, social links, bio, etc.

## Why?

To enable developer advocates to find and collaborate with other developer advocates.

## Sample output

```json
// advocates/:id
{
  "advocates": [
    {
      "profile_pic": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1489066537407365126/iViPGBVE_400x400.jpg",
      "username": "dennisivy11",
      "name": "Dennis Ivy",
      "bio": "YouTuber, contributor at @traversymedia , developer advocate @agoraio and online instructor.",
      "twitter": "https://twitter.com/dennisivy11"
    }
  ]
}
```
